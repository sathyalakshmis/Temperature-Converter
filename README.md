# Temperature-Converter
The application is a basic temperature converter which is done for conversions between celsius and fahrenheit.This is built using tkinter.
There are three files which deal with the conversion.The main file is the basic page where the user can choose an option of either converting °C to °F or °F to °C.
Kelvin is not taken into conversion calculation.From the main file depending on the user's option the control shifts to °C_to_°F file or °F_to_°C file.After the calculation the user also has an option to come back to the main page.
